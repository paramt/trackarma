The script logs an account's total karma and dynamically 
generates a chart with the data it's collected. Below is an example using data 
collected from [/u/GallowBoob](https://www.reddit.com/user/GallowBoob) &ndash;
a Redditor who's infamous for his high karma count. The chart is showing 
live data generated by **Trackarma** and is updated every minute.

## Setup

#### 1. Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/paramt/trackarma.git`

#### 2. Install dependencies
- `pip install praw`
- `pip install matplotlib`

#### 3. Configure PRAW
- Create a new app on Reddit
    * [Follow this link](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)
    * Click `create new app`
    * Choose `personal use script`
    * Add a name and description
    * Click `create app` and copy the ID and secret
- Create a file named `praw.ini` inside the repo
- Make a new configuration that looks like this
```
[Bot]
client_id=[YOUR APP'S ID]
client_secret=[YOUR APP'S SECRET]
username=[YOUR REDDIT USERNAME]
password=[YOUR REDDIT PASSWORD]
user_agent=Karma Tracker Bot 1.0
```

#### 4. Configure Trackarma
- Open `constants.py`
- Change the value of `reddit_name` to the username you're tracking
- Optionally, you can change other constants there (like the chart's title)

#### 5. Set up a scheduled task
Run `sudo python app.py` at a constant interval using [Crontab](https://www.howtogeek.com/101288/how-to-schedule-tasks-on-linux-an-introduction-to-crontab-files/) on Linux or  [Task Scheduler](http://theautomatic.net/2017/10/03/running-python-task-scheduler/) on Windows.
The example's running **Trackarma** every minute, but you may choose to run it at any interval.

## Output
The script will output everything in `data/`

- `chart.png` &ndash; a line graph displaying the Redditor's karma over time
- `karma-total.txt` &ndash; a record of the Redditor's karma over time, separated with newlines
- `karma-delta.txt` &ndash; a record of the Redditor's karma gain over time, separated with newlines
